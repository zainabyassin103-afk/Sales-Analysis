### Project overview
 This project analyzes supermarket sales performance for Q1 2019 using an interactive dashboard to evaluate revenue, profitability, and sales trends across product lines, branches, cities, and customer demographics. The analysis highlights key performance indicators, identifies top-performing categories, and supports data-driven insights for operational and strategic decision-making.
### Data sources
sales data: the primary data used for this project is "supermarket_sales2019" csv file, containing detailed information about each sale made by the store.
### Tools
MYSQL - data cleaning / data analysis
powerBI - data visualization and reporting
## Results/Findings
### Overall Performance
The supermarket generated 322.97K in total sales during the first quarter of 2019, with COGS of 307.59K and a gross income of 15.38K. While the business remained profitable, the narrow margin suggests limited pricing flexibility and potential opportunities for cost optimization.
### Sales by Gender
Female customers contributed slightly more to total sales than male customers, indicating stronger purchasing behavior among female shoppers. This insight can support targeted marketing and loyalty initiatives.
### Product Line Performance
Food & Beverages and Sports & Travel were the highest-selling product lines and served as the main revenue drivers. Other categories, including Electronic Accessories, Fashion Accessories, Home & Lifestyle, and Health & Beauty, showed relatively balanced sales, reflecting a diversified product portfolio.
### Gross Income by Product Line
Gross income was evenly distributed across product lines, suggesting consistent pricing strategies and cost control without heavy reliance on a single category for profitability.
### Sales by City
Sales were almost equally distributed across Naypyitaw, Yangon, and Mandalay, indicating stable demand across all locations and reducing geographic risk.
### Sales by Branch
Branches A, B, and C contributed nearly equal shares of total sales, demonstrating consistent operational performance and similar customer demand across branches.
### Monthly Sales Trend
Sales peaked in January, declined in February, and recovered in March. This fluctuation may be driven by seasonal effects or promotional timing and highlights an opportunity to improve mid-quarter performance.
### Recommendations
Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Increase shelf space, promotions, and inventory focus for Food & Beverages and Sports & Travel, as they are the primary revenue drivers.
- Introduce targeted promotions, bundles, or loyalty incentives during mid-quarter periods to reduce seasonal dips in sales.
- Review pricing strategies and supplier costs across product lines to improve margins, as gross income remains relatively low compared to total sales.
- Develop personalized offers and loyalty programs targeting female customers, who contribute slightly higher sales volume.
- Evaluate marketing, placement, and pricing strategies for lower-performing product lines to stimulate demand without increasing costs.
- Implement ongoing monthly sales tracking to quickly identify fluctuations and respond with timely business actions.
